# Anne Frankly

Anne Frankly is a short simple game made for [Ludum Dare 37 (theme: One Room)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) by [Lyzzi Brooks](https://twitter.com/Lyzzi_Lightyear) using [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/).

In the heat of the Holocaust, join Anne Frank and her family as they hide from SS soldiers in their attic room. 

------------- 

Although technically it's two rooms, the top room is the "one room". Your family members' noise meters rise when they are near each other (and talking too loudly!) Anne is controllable with the directional arrows. Press space when near family members to shush them if they're being too loud. If one of their noise meters reaches the last red tick, you lose.
